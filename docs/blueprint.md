## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm gold (#E3A53E) to add sophistication.
- Background color: Deep navy/teal (#0F172A) in dark mode and light gray (#F4F4F4) in light mode.  These backgrounds are desaturated hues, to avoid distracting the viewer.
- Accent color: Muted teal/gray (#5F7E78) in dark mode and muted blue (#4A90E2) in light mode, adding sophistication to the interface. These accents sit ~30 degrees to the 'left' of our primaries on the color wheel. Because they are more saturated, they stand apart well against our desaturated backgrounds and primaries.
- Headings Font: 'Sora' (sans-serif) for headers.
- Body Text Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Purposeful animations: Use motion to guide attention, provide feedback, and add delight. Ensure all animations respect the prefers-reduced-motion media query.
- Spacing: Use generous padding and gaps throughout the design (e.g., p-4, gap-6) for a spacious feel.
- Borders: Apply large rounded corners (e.g., rounded-2xl) for a modern look.
